## What is our project?
* Exploring: To what extent do lifestyle style choices affect the condition of people's health?
* We chose analyze risk factors in the health field by using a kaggle dataset in the form of a csv file 


## How to Run our Project 
* Clone: [https://github.com/Fionacallahan/FinalProject.git]
* Our Project should run everything but running the finalProject Juptyr Notebook 
* Our code is intertwined into the markdown cells, so it should all be accessible through this platform 


## How Project is Organized 
1. Introduction 
2. Preprocessing 
3. Exploration 
4. Visualization 
5. Classification and Results 
    * Use of: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest 
    * Evaluated by k-fold cross validation 
6. Conclusion
