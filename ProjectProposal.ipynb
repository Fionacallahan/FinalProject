    "## OUR DATA: Healthcare Risk Factor Dataset \n",
    "* **\"Author\"**: AbdalluH ahmed \n",
    "* **NOTE:** Does not originate from real patient records \n",
    "* Updated every 2 months \n",
    "* **Format: CSV file** \n",
    "    * Similar to what we have been working with in class \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Describes individuals' health conditions \n",
    "\n",
    "* Full of 30,000 records \n",
    "* 20 different features (some will be removed due to noise)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Attributes \n",
    "* Most important ones: \n",
    "    * Blood pressure (Decimal)\n",
    "    * BMI (Body Mass Index: Decimal)\n",
    "    * Length of Stay (hospital length of stay (in days))\n",
    "    * Family history (binary: 0 (no) OR 1 (yes))\n",
    "        * Does not go into much detail\n",
    "    * Cholesterol (the level)\n",
    "    * Oxygen Saturation \n",
    "    * Age, Gender\n",
    "* OTHERS: (might be noise)\n",
    "    * Glucose, hbA1c, Smoking, Alchohol, Stress Level, Sleeep Hours, Triglycerides, Diet Score, Physical Activity \n",
    "    * two defininitely noisy columns: \"random_notes\" (a lot of values missing), \"noise_col\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* What will we be classifying? \n",
    "    * Medical Condition: \n",
    "        * EX: Diabetes, Hypertension, Asthma, Obesity \n",
    "    * Other options: Blood Pressure, LengthOfStay, Diet Quality Score \n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Anticipated Challenges \n",
    "* Noise data, missing values \n",
    "* Feature selection techniques: what can we employ \n",
    "    * Some potential options:\n",
    "        1. Entropy: to discover what attributes provide the most amount of information gain \n",
    "        2. Embedded Approach: Include this process as part of the learning algorithm \n",
    "        3. Filter based: Used stats to see what attributes would be most beneficial to keep \n",
    "    * But also, just overall context and knowledge about the realm of health and medicine \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Potential Impact  \n",
    "* Why could our results be useful? \n",
    "* our stakeholders \n",
    "\n",
    "##### CITATIONS \n",
    "* Previous work from Gina Sprint 222 class (final project)\n",
    "* Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallaahmed77/healthcare-risk-factors-dataset/data\n",
