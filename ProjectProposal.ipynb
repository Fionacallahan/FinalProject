    "## OUR DATA: Healthcare Risk Factor Dataset \n",
    "* **\"Author\"**: AbdalluH ahmed \n",
    "* **NOTE:** Does not originate from real patient records \n",
    "* Updated every 2 months \n",
    "* **Format: CSV file** \n",
    "    * Similar to what we have been working with in class \n",
    "* Link at bottom in Citations \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Describes individuals' health conditions \n",
    "\n",
    "* Full of 30,000 records \n",
    "* 20 different features (some will be removed due to noise)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Attributes \n",
    "* Most important ones: \n",
    "    * Blood pressure (Decimal)\n",
    "    * BMI (Body Mass Index: Decimal)\n",
    "    * Length of Stay (hospital length of stay (in days))\n",
    "    * Family history (binary: 0 (no) OR 1 (yes))\n",
    "        * Does not go into much detail\n",
    "    * Cholesterol (the level)\n",
    "    * Oxygen Saturation \n",
    "    * Age, Gender\n",
    "* NOTE: Most of our data is numeric, so might have to discretize certain columns \n",
    "* OTHERS: (might be noise)\n",
    "    * Glucose, hbA1c, Smoking, Alchohol, Stress Level, Sleep Hours, Triglycerides, Diet Score, Physical Activity \n",
    "    * two defininitely noisy columns: \"random_notes\" (a lot of values missing), \"noise_col\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* What will we be classifying? \n",
    "    * Medical Condition: \n",
    "        * EX: Diabetes, Hypertension, Asthma, Obesity \n",
    "    * Other options: Blood Pressure, LengthOfStay, Diet Quality Score \n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Anticipated Challenges \n",
    "* Noise data, missing values \n",
    "    * Will have to decide between keeping these values or using smoothing techniques \n",
    "* Feature selection techniques: what can we employ \n",
    "    * Some potential options:\n",
    "        1. Entropy: to discover what attributes provide the most amount of information gain \n",
    "        2. Embedded Approach: Include this process as part of the learning algorithm \n",
    "        3. Filter based: Use of stats to see what attributes would be most beneficial to keep \n",
    "    * But also, just overall context and knowledge about the realm of health and medicine \n",
    "        * Could also research what specifically determines health conditions that we are looking at \n",
    "* Picking the correct attributes that gives us the best prediction: since there are so many \n",
    "    * Due to what we know about these medical conditions, there should be decent correlation \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Potential Impact  \n",
    "* Why could our results be useful? \n",
    "    * In the health science field, nurses perform similar functions as this to decipher what treatment to go forward with \n",
    "    * Our results could be useful, as well, in determining if this data set needs to be strengthened or not (EX: deleting some features)\n",
    "    * More broadly, medical workers can use this information to help improve classification of medical conditions, thus improving the ability to reconize certain conditions in patients \n",
    "* Stakeholders\n",
    "    * Medical field community \n",
    "    * Owner of this dataset: find out more of its use \n",
    "    * The patients that hold these conditions \n",
    "        * Can see what causes their health states \n",
    "    * Patients that are not in the dataset, and wnat to know why their feeling what they are feeling \n",
    "\n",
    "##### CITATIONS \n",
    "* Previous work from Gina Sprint 222 class (final project)\n",
    "* Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallaahmed77/healthcare-risk-factors-dataset/data\n",
    "* steps on feature selection to improve performance: https://roundtable.datascience.salon/feature-selection-in-machine-learning?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22114556059&gbraid=0AAAAA-Q8n0syzjRlpw-PPjskFoihArYAw&gclid=CjwKCAiAoNbIBhB5EiwAZFbYGJUFHzAZKD0uCvPFmfSJYZN_1D-_ulBynxjBVrLZRKleF4v036fLYRoCW1gQAvD_BwE\n",
